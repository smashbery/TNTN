# **THE NOVUS TRADE NETWORK (TNTN) – Full Transparency Statement**

## **Building a Free & Open Decentralized Trade Network**

### **What is THE NOVUS TRADE NETWORK (TNTN)?**
TNTN is an **open-source, decentralized trade network** that belongs to the people. It is built on **LoRa communication, NAS storage, and secure peer-to-peer (P2P) connections** to enable fair and resilient trade for everyone. **No corporations. No gatekeepers. No centralized control.**

---

## **🌎 Full Transparency & Open-Source Commitment**

### **Everything We Do is Open & Accessible**
✔ **TNTN is 100% Open Source** – No hidden fees, no locked features, no corporate ownership. The code is available for all to see, modify, and improve.
✔ **LoRa & Network Data is Public** – Everyone can see trade listings, local updates, and messages within the network.
✔ **Zero Corporate Control** – No company can dictate how TNTN operates. It is built **by the people, for the people.**
✔ **Built for the Community** – Anyone can contribute, expand, and improve the network.

## **📡 How the LoRa Network Works & Global Frequency Transparency**
The LoRa network is intentionally **lightweight and efficient**, designed to transmit only **small amounts of critical data** to keep communication fast and decentralized. 

✔ **Low Data Transmission** – LoRa is not designed for heavy traffic like video or images. It only transmits essential trade data such as store listings, event updates, and local availability.
✔ **Point-to-Point (P2P) & Node-Based Communication** – The strength of TNTN comes from its reliance on local nodes rather than a traditional internet backbone. Each node **stores and distributes** information with minimal outbound transmission.
✔ **Minimal User Tracking** – The network prioritizes privacy. Only necessary data is transmitted, keeping everything lightweight and efficient.

### **Global LoRa Frequency Allocations**
LoRa operates on unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands, which vary by country:
- **USA & Canada** – 902-928 MHz
- **EU & UK** – 868 MHz
- **Australia & New Zealand** – 915 MHz
- **Japan** – 920 MHz
- **India** – 865-867 MHz
- **China** – 470-510 MHz
- **South America** – 902-928 MHz (similar to the US)

💡 **Why This Matters:**
TNTN operates within legally available frequency bands, ensuring compliance with global wireless communication laws while maintaining full decentralization.

## **🔓 Open-Source Hardware & No Locked Systems**
TNTN is designed so that **anyone** can build a node, run the software, and participate in the network **without restrictions.**

### **How We Handle Hardware & Corporations**
🚫 **No Forced Software or Locked Devices** – If a company wants to sell prebuilt TNTN nodes, they **must** leave them **blank** so users can install the software they choose.
🚫 **No Proprietary Hardware Limitations** – Devices cannot be locked to specific networks or controlled remotely by corporations.
✔ **Custom Hardware is Welcome** – Companies can sell TNTN-compatible hardware **as long as** the software remains open-source and fully user-controlled.

💡 **Why This Matters:**
Some corporations will try to **sell fake “TNTN” devices** that don’t actually work within the network. We are making it clear: **Only open, verified devices can connect.**

---

## **🔐 Security, AI, and User Control First**
TNTN is designed to protect users while remaining open and transparent.

### **How We Keep the Network Safe**
✔ **Users Own Their Data** – No one, not even TNTN, can access private messages or personal data.
✔ **Encryption Protects All Traffic** – All connections are secured with AES-256 encryption.
✔ **No Backdoors, No Surveillance** – TNTN is built to be **resistant to spying, tracking, or corporate interference.**
✔ **No Central Authority** – The community decides how TNTN evolves, not a single company or government.

## **📌 The Future of TNTN: Where We Go From Here**
TNTN is designed to grow **organically, controlled by the people who use it.**

### **Phase 1: Local Trade & Open Testing**
🌍 **Anyone can set up a node** – Raspberry Pi, NAS, or Linux.
📡 **LoRa-based communication begins** – Local markets, messages, and events.
🔒 **Basic encryption & security layers in place** – Protecting users from bad actors.

### **Phase 2: Expansion & Network Growth**
🔹 **More Pi & Linux nodes added** – Strengthening trade communities.
🔹 **USB/MicroSD logins for users** – Allowing secure mobile access.
🔹 **Neighbor Login system** – Users can log in at trusted locations.
🔹 **Future Implementation: Automated Inventory Tracking** – TNTN will explore integrating **smart scales or auto-counters** to help store owners **track inventory automatically.**

### **Phase 3: Cloud Communication (Limited & Secure)**
☁ **Cloud relays introduced** – Allowing mobile users to connect securely.
🚚 **Trade expands through external services** – Farmers markets, delivery networks, etc.
📱 **Cellphone Access (Restricted for Security)** – Mobile devices may require **a proven transaction history or verification** before being allowed to send messages on the LoRa network to prevent corporate spam.
🧠 **Community AI discussions begin** – How AI can assist trade & automation while respecting user privacy.
